# About

These scripts are implementations of the [steepest descent / gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) optimization algorithm for two dimensions. They are built using Matlab, and the minimzation rule was hand-computed to determine the optimal step size for each iteration (alpha). 

The scripts were formulated as solutions to a homework assignment in the WUSTL ESE415 Optimization Course.
